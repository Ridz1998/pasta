# Pasta Project Setup Summary

## Completed Setup Tasks

### 1. Project Structure
Created the complete directory structure as specified:
- `src/pasta/` - Main source code directory
  - `core/` - Core business logic modules
  - `gui/` - User interface components
  - `utils/` - Platform-specific utilities
- `tests/` - Test directory with unit, integration, and fixtures subdirectories
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions CI/CD

### 2. Configuration Files

#### pyproject.toml
- Configured project metadata
- Added all core dependencies (pystray, pyperclip, pyautogui, pillow, PyQt6, psutil, cryptography)
- Added development dependencies (pytest, pytest-qt, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy, pre-commit)
- Configured Ruff linter with 140-character line length
- Set up mypy for type checking
- Configured pytest with appropriate settings

#### .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Added pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Configured Ruff for linting and formatting
- Added mypy for type checking
- Included standard hooks for file cleanup

#### GitHub Actions
- Created test.yml workflow for multi-platform CI/CD
- Configured testing on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- Set up Python version matrix (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)

### 3. Core Module Stubs
Created placeholder implementations for all core modules:
- `clipboard.py` - ClipboardManager class
- `keyboard.py` - PastaKeyboardEngine class
- `storage.py` - StorageManager class
- `hotkeys.py` - HotkeyManager class
- `tray.py` - SystemTray class
- `settings.py` - SettingsWindow class
- `history.py` - HistoryWindow class
- `platform.py` - Platform utility functions
- `permissions.py` - PermissionChecker class
- `security.py` - SecurityManager class

### 4. Testing Setup
- Created comprehensive conftest.py with reusable fixtures
- Added mock fixtures for clipboard, keyboard, platform, and time operations
- Created initial test to verify project structure
- All imports and basic structure tests pass

### 5. Development Environment
- Initialized UV package manager
- Installed all dependencies successfully
- Pre-commit hooks installed and configured
- Linting and formatting applied to all files
- Type checking passes with mypy

## Next Steps

According to the PRD, the next phase is to write tests for the core modules following TDD principles:

1. Write ClipboardManager tests
2. Write PastaKeyboardEngine tests
3. Write PermissionChecker tests
4. Write StorageManager tests

Then implement the actual functionality to make the tests pass.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest -xvs

# Run linting and formatting
uv run ruff check . --fix && uv run ruff format .

# Run type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Run the application
uv run python -m pasta
```
