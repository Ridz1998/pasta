# Clipboard Monitoring Fix

## Issue Description

Users reported two critical issues:
1. When copying text, Pasta would immediately paste it back (sometimes as just the letter "v")
2. Clipboard history was not being saved

## Root Cause

The `_on_clipboard_change` method in `SystemTray` was incorrectly calling `paste_text()` whenever clipboard content changed. This caused:
- Unwanted automatic pasting when users simply copied text
- The "v" issue when keyboard shortcuts were not properly synchronized
- No history being saved to the storage manager

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Auto-Paste Behavior

Changed `_on_clipboard_change` to only save content to history, not paste:

```python
def _on_clipboard_change(self, entry: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Handle clipboard content change."""
    # Always save to history, regardless of enabled state
    with contextlib.suppress(Exception):
        # Save to storage
        self.storage_manager.save_entry(entry)

    # Note: We do NOT automatically paste here!
    # The user copied something - we just save it to history.
    # Pasting should only happen via explicit user action (hotkey, menu, etc.)
```

### 2. Proper Clipboard History

- Clipboard content is now saved to storage whenever it changes
- History is saved even when paste functionality is disabled
- This allows users to build a clipboard history for later use

## Testing

Created comprehensive regression tests in `test_clipboard_monitoring_regression.py`:

1. **test_clipboard_copy_should_not_trigger_paste** - Ensures copying doesn't trigger paste
2. **test_clipboard_content_should_be_saved_to_history** - Ensures content is saved
3. **test_letter_v_paste_regression** - Tests for the "v" typing bug
4. **test_clipboard_monitoring_without_paste_enabled** - Ensures history works when disabled

## Expected Behavior

1. **Copying Text**: When users copy text (Cmd+C), it should:
   - Be detected by clipboard monitoring
   - Be saved to history
   - NOT be automatically pasted

2. **Pasting**: Should only occur via:
   - Manual paste from history window
   - Hotkey (when implemented)
   - Explicit menu action

3. **History**: All copied content should appear in the history window

## Future Improvements

- Implement `quick_paste_hotkey` functionality for manual paste trigger
- Add "Paste from History" menu item
- Consider adding notification when clipboard content is saved
