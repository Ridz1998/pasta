# Testing Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Tests Opening System Windows on macOS**
- **Problem**: Tests were creating real Qt windows with `window.show()` that would interfere with the running system
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `window.show()` calls from tests (specifically in `test_macos_shortcuts.py`)
  - Set `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` environment variable in `tests/conftest.py`
  - Added `PASTA_TESTING=1` environment variable to indicate test mode

### 2. **Coverage Reports Not Being Generated**
- **Problem**: Running tests didn't show coverage reports (neither terminal nor HTML)
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `pyproject.toml` to include coverage options in pytest configuration:
    ```toml
    addopts = "-ra --strict-markers --strict-config --timeout=30 --cov=src/pasta --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html"
    ```
  - Coverage HTML reports are now generated in `htmlcov/` directory
  - Terminal coverage reports show missing lines and branch coverage

### 3. **Pytest Markers Configuration**
- **Problem**: Tests failing with "marker not found" errors
- **Solution**: Added proper marker configuration in `pyproject.toml`:
    ```toml
    markers = [
        "slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m \"not slow\"')",
        "integration: marks tests as integration tests",
        "unit: marks tests as unit tests",
        "gui: marks tests that require GUI",
        "requires_display: marks tests that require a display",
    ]
    ```

## Configuration Changes

### Updated Files:
1. **`pyproject.toml`**:
   - Added coverage reporting to pytest options
   - Added pytest markers configuration

2. **`tests/conftest.py`**:
   - Added `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` to prevent GUI windows
   - Added `PASTA_TESTING=1` environment variable

3. **`tests/integration/test_macos_shortcuts.py`**:
   - Removed `window.show()` call that was opening real windows

## Usage

### Running Tests with Coverage:
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_macos_shortcuts.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
uv run pytest -k "window or dialog"

# View HTML coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # Linux
```

### Coverage Output:
- Terminal: Shows line-by-line coverage with missing lines
- HTML: Detailed interactive report in `htmlcov/` directory

## Benefits:
1. **No System Interference**: Tests run in headless mode without opening visible windows
2. **Better Coverage Visibility**: Both terminal and HTML reports for tracking test coverage
3. **Proper Test Organization**: Tests are properly marked as unit/integration/gui
4. **Consistent Test Environment**: Qt runs in offscreen mode for all tests
